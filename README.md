# flow of the project:

    * A user goes to the website and logs in. (optional)
        * cnot to create a auth feature.

    * The user is present with a blank todo interface (if the user is new then the interface will
    create a new list of the user.) If not, then the user will resume previous sessions.

    * if optional step is not implemented then:
        * user goes to site and interacts with the application.
        * the application has a list of task in which the user can update, delete, create, or read.
        * CRUD - create, read, update, delete.
